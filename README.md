# revaliew
Automating basic workflow for advanced data validation and review, by using statistical analysis such as: 

describing the main uni and multi-variate characteristics of a data set;

finding anomalous patterns, clusters and/or outliers in data;

verifying assumptions about data (and models/statistical tests);

evaluating glm or time series models;

reporting using quantitative measures and visual representations.

This is based on a large number of excellent and well known R-packages.

The revaliew - package is under construction.
