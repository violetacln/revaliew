# revaliew
This package aims to automate basic workflows for advanced data validation and review, by using statistical analysis in order to: 

describe the main uni and multi-variate characteristics of a data set;

find anomalous patterns, clusters, association rules and/or outliers in data;

verify assumptions about data (and models/statistical tests);

evaluate glm or time series models;

report using quantitative measures and visual representations.

This is based on a large number of excellent and well known R-packages.

The revaliew - package is under construction.
